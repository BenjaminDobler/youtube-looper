# Privacy Policy for YouTube Looper

**Last Updated: December 17, 2025**

## Overview

YouTube Looper is a browser extension that helps users create and manage video loops on YouTube. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**YouTube Looper does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

## Data Storage

All data created by YouTube Looper is stored locally on your device using:

- **Browser Local Storage**: Loop information (start time, end time, loop name, playback settings) is stored locally in your browser. This data never leaves your device.
- **No Server Communication**: The extension does not communicate with any external servers or third-party services.
- **No Analytics**: We do not track your usage, collect analytics, or monitor your behavior.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **storage**: To save your loop configurations locally on your device
- **activeTab**: To interact with YouTube pages you're currently viewing
- **scripting**: To inject the loop interface into YouTube pages
- **host_permissions (youtube.com)**: To run only on YouTube pages

These permissions are used solely to provide the loop functionality and are not used to collect or transmit any data.

## Loop Sharing

When you use the "Share" feature:
- Loop data is encoded into a URL that you can share with others
- This happens entirely in your browser - no data is sent to our servers
- The URL contains only loop timing information, not any personal data
- Sharing is completely optional and only happens when you explicitly click the share button

## Third-Party Services

YouTube Looper does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- You have complete control over your data
- Data can be cleared by clearing your browser's local storage
- Uninstalling the extension removes all associated data

## Children's Privacy

YouTube Looper does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated revision date.
